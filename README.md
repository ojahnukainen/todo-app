# todo-app
Everyone need the classic todo application on their github. Here is my take on using React. 

For now it looks sad and uqly, but it work. This was more to get something done and get rid of the plank files. 

Next ToDo task is to actually make this look and feel good from the UX designer point of view.

I have not follwed any tutorial while working with this.

## Basics
So this is just front done with React. Has been created with Vite. Todo tasks are saved in the local db.json file and is run with json-server. Basic light/dark theme has been included.

## To run the app
To get everything up and running

>'npm install'

Run the json-server. As default it's running port 3001

>'npm run server'

To get the application work. It runs in localhost:5173

>'npm run dev'
